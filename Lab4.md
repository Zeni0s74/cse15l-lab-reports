## Lab4 Report : VIM!
***
Today we'll have a bit of an easier lab to get through, we'll be reproducing the activity we did durring our in class lab on our own, step by step!

Now, first we'll want to use `ssh` to remotely access the `ieng6` erver where we'll be doing all of our work, to do this for my user, I enter `ssh nenieto@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
