3. Snakes
  * They eat eggs
  * If you keep them fed, they'll tolerate you!

2. Cats
  * Some cats like to be pat roughly, something about nerve clusters or whatever
  * will probably eat you if you died around them :(

1. Birds
  * They come in many makes and models!
  * Corvids are very smart and loyal
  * Round is the preferred model
